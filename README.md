# Network-Programming

This repository contains Python code for socket programming at both the client and server ends, demonstrating the use of both UDP and TCP protocols.

## OpenFlow Configuration Lab for SDN

This lab involves configuring and managing an OpenFlow network using Mininet and OpenDaylight. The tasks include:

1. **Environment Setup**: Install and configure VirtualBox, import the SDN-Lab-OVA VM, and set up network configurations.
2. **Standalone Mininet Network**: Build and test a basic Mininet network, analyze flow tables, and observe OpenFlow messages.
3. **Integration with OpenDaylight**: Connect Mininet to an OpenDaylight controller, install necessary OpenDaylight features, and explore network topology and flow management using the OpenDaylight GUI and Wireshark.

The lab provides hands-on experience with network emulation, SDN controllers, and OpenFlow message analysis.

## Traffic Enginering Algorithm Development with SDN

The document discusses the development of SDN algorithms designed to enhance Traffic Engineering (TE) and Quality of Service (QoS). It covers how these algorithms improve network performance by optimizing traffic distribution, managing congestion, and ensuring specific performance criteria are met for different types of network traffic.
